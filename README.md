# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

My motivation to create this Prework Study Guide Webpage is to help students become successful developers. I built this webpage
to make everything accessible to the students. I know that most of the students out there are working hard to be able to sustain their needs while
fulfilling their dreams to become a professional developer. By creating this webpage, this will save them more time when they are studying.
What I've learned is that being a developer is not just writing codes and putting random webpages out there, The real goal here is to touch people's lives by hearing User's Stories and making it happen to the best of our abilities to meet their Acceptance criteria.
